# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @TobiasGehrer

I'm a Software Engineering student and developer working in Industrial IT. I enjoy building things that solve real problems, whether it's for work or just for fun in my spare time.

## Tech Stack

I mostly work with:
- **C#** - for backend and enterprise applications
- **Java** - because sometimes you just need that JVM
- **React** - for building interactive UIs
